# Why create new variables?
- Often the raw data won't have a value you are looking for
- You will need to transform the data to get the values ypu would like
- Usually you will add those values to the data frames you are working with
- Common variables to create
  - Missingness indicators
  - "Cutting up" quantitative variables
  - Applying transforms
