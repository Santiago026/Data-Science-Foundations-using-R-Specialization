I'm very excited to start Exploratory Data Analysis, and I hope you are too. This is the fourth course in the Data Science Specialization. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a key element of data science because it allows you to develop a rough idea of what your data look like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them. EDA is often the "fun part" of data analysis, where you get to play around with the data and, well, explore!

The recommended background courses are The Data Scientist's Toolbox and R Programming. It is possible to take this class concurrently with that class but you may have to read ahead in the prerequisite class to get the relevant background for this class. For a complete set of course dependencies in the Data Science Specialization please see the course [dependency chart](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/doc/JHDSS_CourseDependencies.pdf).

As you browse the course web site, please make sure to read through the **syllabus**, which contains important information about the grading policy for the Quizzes and Course Projects as well as the course schedule.

The primary way to interact with me in this course is through the **discussion forums**. Here, you can start new threads by asking questions or you can respond to other people's questions. If you have a question about any aspect of the course, I strongly suggest that you search through the discussion boards first to see if anyone has already asked that question. If you see something similar to what you want to ask, you should up-vote that question using the up-arrow button rather than asking your question separately. The more votes a question or comment gets, the more likely it is that I will see it and be able to respond quickly. Of course, if you don't see a question similar to the one you want to ask, then you should definitely start a new thread on the appropriate forum.

I hope you enjoy the class. I anticipate a fun four weeks!
