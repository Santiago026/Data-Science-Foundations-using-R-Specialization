I just wanted to briefly describe how
to install R for a Windows machine. So the first thing you do is load, launch
your web browser so I'll do that here. I'm using Chrome but
it doesn't really matter. And you need to go to the Comprehensive
R Archive Network or CRAN, so I'll just type that in here. And you'll see that there's,
at the top there's three options. There's Linux, a MAC and Windows. So you can go to the Windows version here. And you wannna click
on the base link here. So you can just click on this link and
the download will start. And so depending on how fast
your internet connection is, this might take a few minutes. Okay, so the downloads finished,
and I'm going to click on this. So, you can choose your language here. There are a number of choices in terms of
the translations that you can choose from. I'm going to choose English,
because that's my, language. And then you can just click
through the installer. It'll kind of walk you
through the various steps. And so we'll do that right now,
just to see what the options are. So you click on Next. You have to agree to the license,
which is the GNU General Public license. So, feel free to read it,
and then click on next. Usually the default
installation directory is fine. So I'm going to go through this. The default user installation is fine. There are other installation set
ups that you can choose from. If you know you have a 32 bit machine, maybe an older machine,
you could click on that. By default it will
install both versions so you don't have to really worry about that. So just click through next on this one. And you can choose to kind of
take all the defaults, or you can try to customize your startup. I'm going to customize the startup just so you can see kind of what
the options are here. So this option here asks you whether
you want an MDI or SDI interface. So what that means, basically, is do you
want R to kind of run in one big window with kind of different sub
windows inside of a big window? Or do you want it to run in
kind of like separate windows? I prefer to use the SDI mode. So the console will be in one window
the the kind of graphics window will be a separate window. I just kind of I feel like I
like that a little bit better. It's easier to work with. So I'm going to click on the SDI option. And then you can choose how you
want to look at your help files. So the HTML help is a little bit nicer,
is prettier to read. And the plain text help is,
well it's just plain text. So maybe I'll just click on
plain text just to be different. And then you can choose whether you want
Standard or Internet2 Internet access. This, generally speaking, you should not
mess with so you just click on Next. You can create a shortcut
in the Start menu. So that's usually a good idea. Okay, you can usually choose the defaults
here in terms of creating a desktop icon. Unless your desktop is very cluttered and
you want to avoid that. So these defaults are fine. So I'll click on Next. And then it'll start installing
the files on your computer. So now it's done and
we can just click on finish here. And you've now installed
R on your computer. And see I've got a desktop icon here so
I'll just double click on that. And there we are, we're running R.
