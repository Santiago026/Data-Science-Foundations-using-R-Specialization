As you make your way through the world of data science, learning R programming and other important skills, it's important to remember that data science isn't just a collection of tools. It requires a person to apply those tools in a smart way to produce results that are useful to people.

I'm delighted to announce that my latest book, [The Art of Data Science](https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience/), is available from Leanpub (printed paper copies are [available from Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/the-art-of-data-science/17220653)). This book addresses the problem of how to think about any data analysis, and how to assemble the tools you've learned and apply them from start to finish. This is the book I wish I'd had when I was first starting out.

I hope you enjoy the book and find it useful. I welcome any feedback as we are continuously working to improve the book.
