### ``` hist() ```
  - [?hist()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/hist)
  - The generic function hist computes a histogram of the given data values. If plot = TRUE, the resulting object of class "histogram"      is plotted by plot.histogram, before it is returned
