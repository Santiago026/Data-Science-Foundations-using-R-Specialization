# Base Plot
  - "artists palette" model
  - Start with the plot Function
	- Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
	- Cant go back and adjust; need to plan in advance

# Lattice System
	- Entire plot specified
	- Plot created with a single fucntion call (xyplot, bwplot, etc)
	- Margins/Spacing set automatically
	- Good for plotting many plots
