# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to The Data Scientist's Toolbox, the first course in the Data Science Specialization series. Here, we will be going over the basics of data science and introducing you to the tools that will be used throughout the series.

Before we get started, we wanted to fill you in the reasoning behind some recent format changes. Please watch the next video, "Why Automated Videos?" to learn more.

The content of each lesson in this course is presented in two different formats, video and "ungraded plugin." The ungraded plugins are simply embedded web pages of the lessons in written form with accompanying illustrations.

You can use either format or both, depending on your preference
