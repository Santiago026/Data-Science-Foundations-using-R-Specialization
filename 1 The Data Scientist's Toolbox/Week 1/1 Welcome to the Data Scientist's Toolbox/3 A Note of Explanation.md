# A Note of Explanation
This course is used in two different specializations. The Data Science Specialization is a 10-course sequence that covers the full length of the data science pipeline, whereas Data Science: Foundations using R covers only the first 5 courses in that sequence. 

If you are taking Data Science: Foundations using R, please note that you will occasionally encounter references to the full 10-course Data Science Specialization. We apologize for any confusion that those references may cause. 

If you would like to continue on to the remainder of the sequence after you complete Data Science: Foundations using R, you can do so by enrolling in Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning.
