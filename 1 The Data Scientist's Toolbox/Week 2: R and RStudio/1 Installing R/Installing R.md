# Installing R
Now that we’ve got a handle on what a data scientist is, how to find answers, and then spent some time going over a data science example, it’s time to get you set up to start exploring on your own. And the first step of that is installing R.

## What is R? What is CRAN?
First, let’s remind ourselves exactly what R is and why we might want to use it.

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is both a programming language and an environment, focused mainly on statistical analysis and graphics. It will be one of the main tools you use in this and following courses.

R is downloaded from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/), or CRAN, and while this might be your first brush with it, we will be returning to CRAN time and time again, when we install packages - so keep an eye out!

## Why should you use R?
Outside of this course, you may be asking yourself - [why should I use R?](https://www.r-bloggers.com/why-use-r-five-reasons/)

The reasons for using R are myriad, but some big ones are:

**1) Its popularity**

R is quickly becoming the standard language for statistical analysis. This makes R a great language to learn as the more popular a software is, the quicker new functionality is developed, the more powerful it becomes, and the better the support there is! Additionally, as you can see in the [graph below](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/), knowing R is one of the top five languages asked for in data scientist job postings!
